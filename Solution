I found a youtube video with a task:

Find all pairs of numbers that in sum equal to a number in function

something like

let array2 = [2,3,6,1,3,4,5,0,7] //7

So, here's my solution, so glad to find it :happy:

var array2 = [2,3,6,1,3,4,5,0,7]

func findNumbers(n: Int, array: [Int]) {

    var foundPairsOfNumbers = [[Int]]() //array of arrays
    var another = array2 //create a copy of a input array
    
    for i in another {
    
            var firstNumber = i //set first number
            var secondNumber = n - firstNumber //set second number
            if another.contains(secondNumber) {
            
                var newArr = [firstNumber, secondNumber]
                foundPairsOfNumbers.append(newArr)
                another.removeAll(where: {$0 == firstNumber}) //delete first number from array to repeat like [num1, num2], [num2, num2]
                another.removeAll(where: {$0 == secondNumber}) //delete second number from array
                
            }
        }
    
    print(foundPairsOfNumbers)
}

findNumbers(n: 7, array: array2)

I know that this code might be faster and much shorter, but now it looks cool for me.


//need to work more under code, cause it's not working with a different test
